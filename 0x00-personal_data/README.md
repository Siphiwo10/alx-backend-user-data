Write a function called filter_datum that returns the log message obfuscated:

Arguments:
fields: a list of strings representing all fields to obfuscate
redaction: a string representing by what the field will be obfuscated
message: a string representing the log line
separator: a string representing by which character is separating all fields in the log line (message)
The function should use a regex to replace occurrences of certain field values.
